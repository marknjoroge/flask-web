        <h1>THE PRESIDENT</h1>
        <p>The president of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States of America. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.</p>
        <p>The power of the presidency has grown substantially since its formation, as has the power of the federal government as a whole. While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly strong role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, with a notable expansion during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. In contemporary times, the president is also looked upon as one of the world's most powerful political figures as the leader of the only remaining global superpower. As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power.</p>

        <h1>Duties Of The Office</h1>
        <p>The Constitution succinctly defines presidential functions, powers, and responsibilities. The presidentâ€TMs chief duty is to make sure that the laws are faithfully executed, and this duty is performed through an elaborate system of executive agencies that includes cabinet-level departments. Presidents appoint all cabinet heads and most other high-ranking officials of the executive branch of the federal government. They also nominate all judges of the federal judiciary, including the members of the Supreme Court. Their appointments to executive and judicial posts must be approved by a majority of the Senate (one of the two chambers of Congress, the legislative branch of the federal government, the other being the House of Representatives). The Senate usually confirms these appointments, though it occasionally rejects a nominee to whom a majority of members have strong objections. The president is also the commander in chief of the countryâ€TMs military and has unlimited authority to direct the movements President of the United States of land, sea, and air forces. The president has the power to make treaties with foreign governments, though the Senate must approve such treaties by a two- thirds majority. Finally, the president has the power to approve or reject (veto) bills passed by Congress, though Congress can override the presidentâ€TMs veto by summoning a two-thirds majority in favour of the measure.</p>
